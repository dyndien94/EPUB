<h2 class="h2b">Back to Biology: Epigenetics and Vestibular Regulation</h2>
<h3 class="h1">Epigenetics 101</h3>
<p class="noindent">There is this funny little thing called <em class="calibre2">epigenetics</em> that rules us all. Referenced in passing in earlier chapters, what epigenetics simply means is how our individual genetics mix with all the potential influences in our individual environment. This mix makes each of us who we are. Think a convergence of nature and nurture. The proportionate influence of each—genes, alleles, and environment—however is always a tricky one. And with our current state of knowledge, still rather unpredictable. Epigenetics is like Russian roulette in the negative and the lottery in the positive: In Russian roulette, most of us know there is a bullet, but we don’t know where it is in the six-chamber gun. Nor in the lottery do we know if we are holding the right or wrong numbers until the outcome is announced. Epigenetics is oddly veiling for something so critical. As we are increasingly learning, epigenetics are not only important, but central in resilience, health, and illness, of both mind and body. They are also central in addiction—all forms of addiction.</p>
<p class="indent">We know there are 93-year-old smokers out there who are otherwise physically fit as fiddles. Their bodies spry and their minds sharp, and their lungs have atypical resilience to daily if not hourly self-pollution. Wisely, however, we do not recommend that people start or continue smoking to find out if they belong to this unique and extremely resilient genetic group. We also know that there are some factors that will influence regardless of genetic hardiness or life span. For example, if a 93-year-old started smoking at nine, they would probably be one inch <a id="page_156" class="calibre1"></a>(3 cm) shorter than the same 93-year-old who started smoking at 18 (after the human growth cycle is mostly complete).</p>
<p class="indent">But it is also what you start with. Let’s throw in some color theory to exemplify. If you are genetically a blue person and the environment tosses you a good dose of yellow, you will become green. If you are a genetically red person and the environment tosses the same yellow at you, you will become orange. Your base color (blue or red), your base genetics, will determine what color you turn with exposure (mixing) with yellow. The reverse is also true. If you are a blue person and get tossed red you would become purple; whereas if you were blue and tossed yellow again you would be green. So the question is both what is your base genetic color and what is/are the colors you are being exposed to, or mixed with? Depending on how many colors we are talking about we have outcomes that cross the rainbow and back, and also those that make mud.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s skip to a human example most of us can personally relate to: alcohol. Most of us know that certain someone who can down a half bottle of 52% scotch and seem relatively unaffected. They don’t slur, they don’t lose their balance, or their temper, and they don’t get hangovers. Now I don’t recommend they drive a car or sign any important documents in that state, but compared to most of us these drinkers are disproportionately functional. Conversely, there is the person who, with but half a glass of 9% white wine is completely loopy. Then there are all the people in between: the loud drunks, the quiet ones, the angry ones, the delightfully happy ones, the entertaining ones, and the perfect moderates who enjoy just enough to enhance the taste of food and conversation and relax a little. Lastly there is a relatively small portion of individuals (typically whose genetic heritage is Asian) who take but a sip or two and do not feel inebriated or relaxed. They experience no positive affect or effect whatsoever, they just feel ill: horribly, dreadfully ill as if they ingested some form of toxin. This is all genetics. Reactions of people of the rainbow all getting liquid yellow tossed at them.</p>
<p class="indent">So why all this talk of smokers, drinkers, and rainbows? Well this is what we need to consider with i-tech. Are you a genetic blue person or a genetic red one? Do you live in an environment of yellow, green, or also red? What “color” do you become with i-tech? Or what color do <a id="page_157" class="calibre1"></a>you become with i-tech and conflict, or i-tech and work, or i-tech and happiness?</p>
<p class="indent">At almost every lecture or interview I am asked to give a standard recommendation or time limit for i-tech usage. The answer unfortunately due to epigenetics is “it depends.” And, in a world that wants, in fact demands absolutes, that can be a problem. In the meantime, if you are unsure and if you have to ask the question, I would suggest, just as with alcohol, act like a moderate. Use tech as the beautiful tool it was designed to be and perhaps a little to enhance the taste of food and conversation. But the second it overrides human connection or your own arousal, reduce.</p>
<p class="indent">For children, because development is in full continuous throttle, it is significantly harder to predict where harmless and harmful converge. In the next few chapters I will arm you with much to help those of you who are parents and educators make informed choices.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, until you know what “color” your child is, one hour a day (for older children only) appears to be the healthy cutoff. If you need any more supporting evidence, take a note from the choices of the parents who work in the i-tech industry (not the factory workers but the developers, the ones in the know of what they do because they design them!). At the Peninsula Waldorf school in Silicon Valley they do not allow screens — any screens — in the classroom until eighth grade. And who attends this school? Seventy-eight percent of the students are the children of elite tech industry developers.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch11fn1" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch11fn1" class="calibre1">1</a>,<a id="Rch11fn2" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch11fn2" class="calibre1">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h1">Of Simplicities and Complexities</h3>
<p class="noindent">And now it’s time to really examine our current reality: Over the past five years things have gotten considerably more complex. We are advancing deeper into i-technologies continuing to be enthralled by the possibilities and, from my professional perspective, wearing complete blinders as to the caveats.</p>
<p class="indent">When any advancement is so one sided we are heading for disaster. Not only do we have problems, we have calamities — personal calamities and cultural ones. In the region where I practice, iPads/tablets are now required for fourth grade curriculum in most districts. Many private schools further promote themselves as being more technologically <a id="page_158" class="calibre1"></a>advanced. This is a feature to attract students and parents — and not only local Canadian students, but many foreign students as well (particularly those from the Pacific Rim). And the average cost such of cutting-edge i-education in private school: $25,000 per year.</p>
<p class="indent">From my side of the looking glass many things are going wrong here. I’m going to refrain from comments on specific programs and platforms and just repeat my qualifier: There are many wonderful things that can be accomplished and/or experienced through screen-based technologies and only screen-based technologies. They have unquestionably broadened experience and access, and hence learning too. Technologies can and do provide wonderful and most innovative opportunities for learning. That said, when applied arbitrarily, indiscriminately, and universally the benefits start to reduce drastically.</p>
<p class="indent">The three key issues I see in education are <em class="calibre2">too much, too long</em>, and <em class="calibre2">too young</em>. Precisely what I preach in home or personal usage as well. Add to that, lack of direction, and replacing as opposed to complementing human interface in the classroom, and you can spiral pretty quickly from beneficial applications to potentially detrimental outcomes. This applies both to learning itself as well as developmental process.</p>
<h3 class="h1">Simple Answers — Underarousal</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s start with <em class="calibre2">too much</em> and <em class="calibre2">too long</em>. Too long is quite simple. If young children are spending six hours a day interacting primarily with screens in the classroom, they are potentially hyperaroused for six hours, and their whole dopaminergic system is not quite functioning as it was designed. Now the positive here is children are more engaged by arousal. So on the surface it appears they are paying more attention to their lessons and their screen-based exercises.</p>
<p class="indent">Actually they are (got you!). For all the reasons outlined in previous chapters — and a few more to come. They also pay attention longer to a screen than to a person. As mentioned earlier, though, just because something lengthens the attention span of a child does not mean it is better for learning or for the child — or that it’s good to lengthen attention span per se.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it is an artificial extension, and there is a cost. As any parent of small children knows, when a young child is overengaged <a id="page_159" class="calibre1"></a>for any significant period of time in high arousal (and usually fun) activities (say at the pool or the beach all day), at some point they hit a seemingly automatic off button. The lucky ones just fall asleep to figuratively reboot; the unlucky (for parents that is) become mood deregulated, grumpy, unhappy, unsatisfiable, and prone to pretty significant tantrums. During school hours, many children hit this off period when they disengage from i-tech — many at just about the time you pick them up from school, or they have to go to other rule bound or organized activities such as karate, soccer practice, or dance class. And the only thing that will calm or satisfy them in the transition (apart from the probably much needed nap and maybe a little snack) is (you got it) more screen time. Hence the double appeal of screen interaction in the car as a parent drives them from point A to B.</p>
<h3 class="h1">The Natural Reboot and the Vestibular Regulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">What is actually needed post-screen time is a physical reboot, not a metaphoric one. Completely unstructured, unbridled physical activity like running around the park, swinging on high or low swings, jumping on a trampoline or a pogo stick. Enter the <em class="calibre2">vestibular system</em>. Most people know the basics of the vestibular system — its role in balance and movement, essentially the inner ear stuff — but few realize how central this system is to all development. Even fewer are aware of how much screens have the potential to completely change how the whole (vestibular) system is designed to work.</p>
<h3 class="h1">Vestibular Regulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">The vestibular system is responsible for both primary organization of, and response to, sensory input — all sensory input, not just balance. The system is responsible for equilibrium in a much larger sense, and as such is married to input from our eyes, from our ears, even the hairs on our arms. All these sensory inputs are processed in tandem by the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="indent">The way I see it, the vestibular system acts like a captain running the master control part of the brain for attention, arousal, safety, and survival. We are back to ERP waves, motor control, impulsivity, fight, freeze, and flight. The whole gambit — not just inner ear and balance. <a id="page_160" class="calibre1"></a>And when is the vestibular system developing? From day one until about, again, age nine. And how does it develop? Through real world experience.</p>
<p class="indent">It starts with infants rolling and crawling, then toddlers climbing and jumping, then slightly older children swinging and running. Let’s not forget running. There is a certain age in early childhood where children seem to do nothing but run. It’s like the child’s system has sped up and the “walk” feature is on the fritz for a year, two, and for some even three. And then, as if by magic, the child rediscovers their ability to walk. There is also a phase where many kids just love hanging upside down; not just on monkey bars but on sofas and beds. Anything they can curve their little bodies around. And then there’s swinging and being flung. This is the stuff of childhood.</p>
<p class="indent">This physical activity is the stuff of development too. A lot of early to mid-childhood behavior is actually experimentation with the vestibular system and the thrill to be gotten from it. Swinging, hanging upside down, and spinning are all great, great fun, but also have a critical role in development. These activities have very functional developmental purpose. They are setting up the entire system: balance, safety, attention, and even mood. A big part comes from the vestibular-ocular reflex where the vestibular sensors (in the inner ear) sense motion of the head and send it on for processing by the central nervous system. As the system learns to process, so do we. We learn the rules of our bodies in our physical environment.</p>
<p class="indent">When is it complete? It’s a bit different for all of us, but about the time hanging upside down and summersaults start being less fun, and we need a fear factor or significant physical challenge to get the same rush or amusement. So I would say more in and around adolescence than the textbook age of nine. Note how I said <em class="calibre2">fear factor</em> or <em class="calibre2">challenge</em>. When we are older fun comes from challenging the system, not setting it up. And, for the majority of us, the older we get the less fun we experience with balance games alone. We can only engage the fun part playing with particular avenues of the central nervous system via a danger message from the brain. When older, we play with <em class="calibre2">physical-visceral response</em>, or fear versus logic. As adults we still get fear in our bellies on the roller coaster, but we logically know we are strapped in and a <a id="page_161" class="calibre1"></a>few engineers have been involved in ensuring our safety. The older we get many of us also get less of the “weeeee!” factor and more nausea. Unless we are on the super-duper rides. Then we all experience the joy of sheer terror.</p>
<p class="indent">Back to kids, children who have not tested the vestibular system sufficiently through unbridled play don’t get full spectrum mapping of danger signals. They don’t learn to discriminate well between what is a little dangerous, a lot dangerous, what requires more balance and coordination to stay upright, or where they should concentrate their focus for success on a physical task, for example. Equally important, all the tests we get from real world observation and play from birth to nine give us all of our baselines from which we function for the rest of our lives. What happens when we have insufficient testing procedures? Well, we have inefficient or inaccurate responses, which can include increased anxiety responses.</p>
<p class="indent">So how do screens interfere? Well the basic answer is if an infant, then child is frequently on a screen in the cradle, then on the floor, then on the sofa, in school, and at recess; they are not engaging their vestibular system. Period. And if you don’t get sufficient input from zero to nine years of age, you can get some pretty mucked up output determinants! You can easily become either recklessly impulsive (no respect for danger where danger exists) or excessively cautious (disproportionately fearful of danger when none, or relatively little exists). The reason: you have no accumulated physically or mentally banked knowledge. No idea, by experience of limits. Many therapists and teachers (and anyone who has worked consistently with children through a few generations) are noticing both an increase in the polarization of these “personalities” and their medical classifications: none other than impulsive forms of ADHD and childhood anxiety disorders. Why have I placed <em class="calibre2">personalities</em> in quotation marks? Because I’m not sure we are seeing predetermined personality per se — but rather a blooming of states and traits due to increased screen exposure and reduced interpersonal and inter-environmental exposure. I believe <em class="calibre2">one is at the expense of the other</em>. It is the environmental influence of screens with a twist of parenting and schooling. Yes I am talking epigenetics in action. With either excessive, or just too early and too frequent introduction <a id="page_162" class="calibre1"></a>to i-tech (yellow), the genetically blue kids go green (impulsive ADHD) and the red kids go orange (anxiety). That’s some powerful yellow!</p>
<div class="bggray">
<p class="sb-text"><span class="images"><img alt="image" src="../Images/DY.jpg" class="calibre8"/></span> We now have a little vestibular twist on phobias. For example, children and fear of elevators. It used to be a branch of claustrophobia made a little stronger by sensation of motion (small vestibular stuff). And that condition was rather rare. Today, children’s fear of elevators has little to do with fear of enclosed small spaces and avoidance of such. Today I argue it is dominantly vestibular. Reactions appear have little to nothing to do with conscious choices of avoidance but rather sensory destabilization. We now have children who are not initially afraid of riding an elevator, but kids who can’t. Children who experience dizziness, physical destabilization, and nausea. Only after that experience do they become fearful and panic.</p>
<p class="sb-text1">There has always been variation in human vestibular regulation: think of people with car sickness, fear of heights, and such. There is varying prevalence in the general population based on (epi)genetics. But it seems to me the numbers here too are rising. The culprit I fear may be too much screen time and not enough outdoor play. (For doctoral students out there: this could potentially be an excellent dissertation should anyone care to venture into the research territory.)</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h1">Twists and Flips—Threshold Engagement</h3>
<p class="noindent">There often are complex, and seemingly contrary, answers to intriguing problems. In the case of vestibular development this is very much the case. Here comes the flip; the part where we discuss not underengagement of the vestibular (and visual system combined) but overengagement or what we call threshold engagement.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre2">Threshold engagement</em> simply means engaging at the very limits of our capabilities. I’ve already gone over the arousal levels, pacing cycles, and the ding and bing effect of constant connectivity. But I want to expand now a bit more on pacing. Specifically, the speed of the delivery of information, or the speed of the information system itself—not merely content (educators are watching content) but movement, sound, color, <a id="page_163" class="calibre1"></a>all of it. Everything that surrounds content. This applies a little more to gaming, searching, and such. But, as primary school curriculum incorporates more, rather than less gamification format and its features, threshold engagement becomes more of an issue in classrooms too.</p>
<p class="indent">When children are on screens the pace of everything can be very quick. Pardon the repetition but I want to reinforce this is not just games. The pace of variation change; be it a blink, a bing, a background or foreground color, a macro or micro movement on the screen, continuous or repetitive. All demand attention — usually simultaneous or concurrent attention. Except little children’s brains can’t go that fast. In order to process from all fields, in order to stay engaged, they are teetering at the absolute limits of their brain capacity. This is what we mean when we speak of threshold engagement. To maintain attention the young brain is in 17th gear just a hair below maximum attention threshold tolerance. With this we get hyperfocus. We need it. If we don’t hyperfocus we can’t keep up! Which looks good in the classroom — but again, for all the wrong reasons. Almost everyone has directly experienced or witnessed the extreme of this: not being able to get a child’s attention while they are in front of a screen. Softly calling, then yelling, even waving hands in between their eyes and the screen. Nada! That’s how hyperfocused these kids have become. They needed to become hyperfocused to process all of the information presented by the screen. But they are not just hyperfocused — they are locked.</p>
<h3 class="h1">Vestibular System Locking</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have moved far beyond arousal and brain reward systems now to what I call <em class="calibre2">vestibular system lock-in</em>. This state is not about reward; it is about attention survival — what developing brains need to do to maintain functional attention when things are just too fast or too much. There is another ADHD connection here too. Those children who have neurologically (not environmentally) based ADHD are more prone to heavier lock-in than those who don’t. This is why children with ADHD have seemingly higher or deeper attention when on screens. They need to. Tragically (from both an educator and clinician’s perspective) this ability of a screen to induce hyperfocus is often used as rationale for more screen-based learning for those with compromised attention. <a id="page_164" class="calibre1"></a>I argue very strongly it is precisely why we need less screen time, not more, with children with ADHD. You are not making the problem better, but worse. If you reinforce the need for hyper arousal to get hyper attention, regular life and the real world thereafter will no longer sustain any functional attention. Essentially people will become nonfunctional or dysfunctional unless life is presented in extremely high-paced, reward-driven formats (more on this later too).</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, what happens with children (immediately after engagement) when the screens are removed or turned off? In developmental stages where the brain is still learning how to self-regulate; when the brain is still in its set-up phase, there is a total void — and extreme discomfort. The void is so strong children will need to reregulate. They need to reboot. How do they do this? Well they bounce off the walls when back in the real environment because the stimulation/attention system was on full power and now literally nothing. Nothing! For those with ADHD doubly so. Again, it is not because the child with ADHD is more hyper, it is because they have been in heaver lock-in and therefore need heavier or more intense rebooting of the vestibular system.</p>
<p class="indent">Picture both the deafness, the complete silence, and the ringing in one’s ears after being exposed to extremely loud music for an hour or two. You need to shake that feeling out of your head. For children taking a screen away is much more than a lollipop being pulled out of one’s mouth. It is a complete void.</p>
<h3 class="h1">Screen Locked-In Syndrome</h3>
<p class="noindent">I have not spoken much yet of what lock-in really means. Nor about its cost. Here goes: When we have full attentional lock-in at threshold limits — something has to give. What gives is the regulation system. It turns off too. Remember a paragraph or two ago when I called the vestibular system a master brain controller, the captain of the human brain-body ship? Well, I was not kidding. The vestibular system when it locks not only locks attention and to a certain degree movement, it also locks emotions. With such locking children are in perfect neutral like in a rocking chair or a swinging cradle (many even do rock on screens as supplementary self-soothing technique). They don’t feel hunger <a id="page_165" class="calibre1"></a>either. But when the system unlocks with disengagement children will find themselves experiencing deregulation. They will need emotional rebooting too. This is the association with tantrums. At the moment of disengagement many feel much more than disquiet, they feel void, panic even, before their “natural” systems come back online.</p>
<p class="indent">How to make it stop: Run wild. Many children innately know when screens are no longer an option, the best way to reboot the physical system (and the emotional system as well) is by going full throttle in the opposite direction. Bouncing around on chairs, sofas, and beds, running wild circles around the living room and up and down halls. Making great noises and crashes. Intentionally bumping into things and people. They are literally trying to wake up their senses. The alternatives? A full tantrum or get back on a screen.</p>
<p class="indent">The younger a child, the more affected they tend to be. This is a simple developmental issue. The less developed the visual system, and by proxy the vestibular system, the more a child will need to focus to attend. The more a child needs to focus the more systems will shut down to enable said focus.</p>
<p class="indent">The pausing and even potential rewiring of emotional processing/ emotional development in these situations is most concerning from a therapist’s perspective. As children get older (and now generation and exposure contingent) they will remain underdeveloped or alternately developed (remember neuronal Darwinism) or they will slowly switch from vestibular-ocular reflex system regulation to reward system regulation. You got it : a screen addict is born…or should I say made? So how much is too much and how early is too early? It depends: one minute, 15 minutes, an hour or more? It will depend on both the age of your child and the epigenetic “color” of your child. Whenever a child manifests lock-in, physical or emotional destabilization or tantrums post engagement — it means it is too much (and/or too early).</p>
<p class="indent">So there is some polarized stuff going on here depending on how locked you are. On one level you feel good on a screen because of all of the reward. On another level you feel good because you feel nothing at all. Regardless you feel “ungood” when you disengage. I think we now have a new syndrome: I’m calling it <em class="calibre2">Screen-based Locked-In syndrome</em>.</p>
<h3 class="h1"><a id="page_166" class="calibre1"></a>Comparing Adults and Children</h3>
<p class="noindent">Keep in mind when your spouse or boyfriend ignores you or waves you away when on a screen it is usually not lock-in. Vestibular lock-in is more a feature of the young. When your adult girlfriend does not pay attention to what you are saying, this is either because she does not want the dual attention (essentially, she wants to finish her text or her game before engaging with you) or because she is deep in reward. She’s getting a little high off the process, and your talking is interrupting that feeling. She is annoyed by you — and acting like an addict. But she is usually not so locked in that she does not know you are there.</p>
<p class="indent">So that is too much. What of too long? Well for most, if you are not on a screen for too long, none of the above has time to lock you. Which unfortunately brings me back to the pernicious nature of screen systems. The faster the pace (visual, sound, content) the longer the child stays engaged. The faster the pace (visual, sound, content) the deeper the child needs to focus. The longer the child stays engaged, the more deregulated they become. The more deregulated they become the more need for rebooting. This is starting to sound a lot like the old song “There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly!” — only now she is now trying to swallow an elephant.</p>
<p class="indent">And too young? There will be a lot more of that in upcoming chapters, but for this chapter let’s just summarize: The younger you introduce screens, the more foundational developmental systems are potentially compromised. Best remedy or parenting strategy: less is better, later is better and when your children do engage make sure you run them like greyhounds after. Lastly, if your district, school, or a specific instructor uses what seems to you to be an unnecessary or disproportionate amount of screen tech in the classroom, you might want to have a chat with them or consider extreme limitation in the realms where you have full parental control.</p>
<p class="indent">To conclude this section, an extremely dense yet scientifically rigorous work looks at how we calibrate as humans. Through precise neurochemical analysis and mathematical formulas, Drs. Softky and Benford (2017) look at our well-being in a paper titled “Sensory metrics of neuromechanical trust.” The conclusion of their study is that the <a id="page_167" class="calibre1"></a>sensory motor data from artificially generated neuromechanical interactions (aka i-tech) violate “the implicit statistical contract for which self-calibration evolved” and that “humans require sensory motor data from organic three-dimensional space to maintain trusting relationships and peace of mind.” Our interactions online “violate[s] the brain’s statistical contract with Nature” and are “incompatible with human sensory processing circuitry and damage[s] social trust.” Translated from Science to English: i-Tech usage disrupts our ability to calibrate, to self-regulate. We emotionally regulate, find trust and peace, through real life including face-to-face interactions such as eating food together, sitting close together, and walking about in nature. The process of gaming and i-tech searching et cetera, changes how our brains function on a biological level — and our brains and bodies simply can’t handle i-tech without emotional cost. i-Tech neurochemically, and hence biologically, dysregulates our feelings of safety and security. Period.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch11fn3" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch11fn3" class="calibre1">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Earlier works have found much the same. Moving beyond hunter gatherer theories of attention in ADHD (e.g., Dr. Hartman referenced earlier), to foraging theory in internet addiction, Drs. Gazzely and Rosen (2016) have mathematically calculated natural or evolutionary appetites for information versus artificial (i-tech) appetites for information. The usual (brain and body) energy required to pay attention to one’s natural environment is substantially different from that required for screen environments. The authors differentiate between what they call 3-space (natural real world three-dimensional environments) and spatial travel or movement within which they call R (R for region covered) versus what they call N-space (the space on the internet). They look at how R in nature is now R × 1000 (and more, and more) online. Please do go to both the aforementioned works for exponential mathematical (and chemical) calculations if you wish.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch11fn4" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch11fn4" class="calibre1">4</a>,<a id="Rch11fn5" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch11fn5" class="calibre1">5</a></sup> But all you really need to know is this is some of the concrete science behind the theory including my ERP waves and the deregulation of the vestibular system. These studies also speak indirectly to belonging. They provide scientific evidence of the complete hijacking of our physiological, and therefore emotional, biology for attention management. Bottom line, the magnitude of information provided by i-tech systems is disproportionate to <a id="page_168" class="calibre1"></a>any natural environment humans have previously been presented with, and our emotional systems suffer for it. From an evolutionary perspective, our brains and bodies just can’t process—we are just not ready.</p>
<div class="bggray1">
<p class="sb-text"><span class="images"><img alt="image" src="../Images/DY.jpg" class="calibre8"/></span> Some parents have battled quite successfully to have districts change their policies about use of screens in classrooms. Both in i-tech content and structure—but also due to EMF concerns (more on this in upcoming chapters). Just as there are private schools that advertise cutting edge i-tech, there are schools that advertise and promote the fact that they have no i-tech until the older grades. In such schools, when technologies are introduced, they are used as tools and tools only.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Now it might be rather unfair to place all this process and development information amongst the education chapters, it could just as easily fit in the gaming segments or under parenting and other personal or home use. But as recesses and lunch breaks at school are getting shorter. As we sterilize school playgrounds. As we keep children who need extra time in class to finish their work. As we restrict recess as a form of punishment for behavioral issues AND we remove activities that inherently require less screens and a little more movement (namely sports and arts: visual arts, drama, music, and after school team sports) from curriculum, classes, and afterschool programs, we need to look at the effects of screens in an educational context too.</p>
<p class="indent">If curriculum planners want to introduce more teacher convenience, save the trees, and have variation in educational format go for it: have e-based chapter books, teach keyboarding and digital note-taking as an addition to scribing, and maths via computer interface. But only at times and in quantities that are age appropriate. I can not overemphasize this. Know not only your pedagogy but your biology (and psychology too). Buff up regularly on learning theory (i-tech has changed all that and will continue to do so). Program and schedule accordingly. For example, know the effects of blue light on circadian rhythm, the hormonal system, and melatonin suppression and schedule e-reading in the morning not the afternoon in winter. Play screen-based games to learn math but not so much that the (addiction) reward centers are <a id="page_169" class="calibre1"></a>triggered. Ensure that “answers” are not polarized by programs and programmers and allow for and encourage, true scientific discovery. Lastly don’t get bamboozled by developers, producers, and salespeople. The i-tech education industry involves big, and I mean BIG, money and everybody wants a piece. In many regards this industry is starting to frighteningly resemble some of the negative aspects of the health and pharmaceutical industry. Products touted and sold for our supposed benefit, our health and welfare have less desirable effects too. In the education industry many promoters and salespeople present true, but selective, and often noncomprehensive research that don’t match the facts of emergent science.</p>
