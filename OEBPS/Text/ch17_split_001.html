  <h2 class="h2b">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly— Esports and the Business of Gaming</h2>

  <h3 class="h1">What’s in a Name, What’s in a Game: Esports</h3>

  <h4 class="h2"><em class="calibre2">What’s in a Name?</em></h4>

  <p class="noindent">So what’s the deal with esports? Esports are what were previously referred to as video games or console games and generically referred to as screen-based games. They then jumped up a notch and became interactive. You could play with or against other people not only in your living room but across or via your screen anywhere in the world. Accordingly, the name switched too: to Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG abbreviated further to MMO). The whole lot is now called esports.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn1" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn1" class="calibre1">1</a></sup> But what are they exactly? What does esport mean?</p>

  <p class="indent">To most of us sport implies physical activity, along with strategy, and often a good dose of fun for participants, supporters, and spectators alike. Looking again at definitions, most major English language dictionaries agree. Oxford, Cambridge, and Merriam-Webster all refer to “physical exertion,” “physical effort,” or a precise set of “physical activities.”<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn2" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn2" class="calibre1">2</a></sup> The common feed is “physical” hence why I’m not sure sitting on a chair or living room sofa or, for the little ones, a living room floor pushing into each other’s shoulders—and the occasional jumping up and down with a win (or tantrum with a loss) should qualify. Only when we get pretty far down definition listings to colloquialisms (in standard or scholarly dictionaries) and to publicly generated definitions (e.g., Wikipedia) does the concept of a video game enter the notion of a sport.</p>

  <p class="indent">As far as I see it, titling here is not referring to the next generation of sports in the digital age, but rather an intentional confounding of nomenclature of sports versus games for perhaps less than innocent or otherwise capitalistic purpose of the industry. A sport can be a game, and a game a sport, but they are not synonymous. I believe confounding the meanings of these words is purposeful and with psychological intent. Associating video games, console games and any playful interactive screen-based activity with sport is purposely intended to piggyback the positive and healthy connotation we have with the term “sport” onto isolated and sedentary activity.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">Sports and Games</h3>

  <p class="noindent">A sport by definition is more elite than a game. It is associated with skill, structure, rules, and character as we can see in our idiomatic use “be a good sport,” or “he’s a good sport.” <em class="calibre2">Games</em>, in contrast hold a place in our psyche as child’s play, silly, fun, pass times, trickster behavior, dismissible behavior, and can have even stronger negative connotations (e.g., “Don’t fall for his games”). In sum, with one great exception namely the Olympic Games and derivative concepts (e.g., Commonwealth Games, Highland Games) in the modern psyche of those of us with English as our mother tongue, we equate games with fun and sport with skill.</p>

  <div class="bggray">
    <p class="sb-text"><span class="images"><img alt="image" src="../Images/DY.jpg" class="calibre8"/></span> Originally the Olympic Games were a Panhellenic religious festival across Greece and its City States. The festival honored the god Zeus and was full of various contests of which a set of sports were only a part. The games included races in armor, races in mule carts and chariots, heralder and trumpeter competitions as well as contests in poetry and music, some sources even say sacrifices (we suspect mostly cows for Zeus followed by a big BBQ). The Olympic Games (and other sporting competitions like the Highland Games etc.) were designed for religious honoring and a time of great fun!<sup class="calibre12"><a id="Rch17fn3" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn3" class="calibre1">3</a></sup></p>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Now, before I travel further down the negative path, or otherwise dissect the industry and practice of gaming, let me once again repeat: For many there is absolutely nothing, NOTHING wrong with gaming. In fact, screen-based games can be fantastic. They can be immensely entertaining and an exciting way to defuse a little energy and so deserve enjoying. As I have said numerous times, and outlined in detail in previous chapters, we need more fun in our lives. But, when gaming morphs into obsession, replaces and supersedes multiple forms of physical and mental leisure activity, adversely starts to affect physical health, mental health and the welfare of entire generations, thwarts attention and school performance, and renders parenting a relentless chore if not hourly fight…it stops being fun!</p>

  <p class="indent">My issue, from the perspective of a practicing therapist, is not with gaming itself but gaming’s addictive properties and its seemingly systematic ability to annihilate all else good and fun. For gaming to maintain benefit it needs be one of many things older children (and adults) do. As one of many aspects of learning and play, it can be entirely innocuous and even positive for its enjoyment factor (in community or solo). In appropriate quantities games can also have situational social benefit and learning benefit (e.g. strategy benefit in learning how to use a tool). But this is not the way most children and adults play them.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">Labeling Genius</h3>

  <p class="noindent">I take issue with what I perceive as a systematic manipulation and even deceit in propagating what gaming does and does not do or provide. Back to the nomenclature, calling screen-based games sports was the first move, the psychological set up. It is a misdemeanor at best and intentional deceit at worse. And sadly, an act of total promotional genius. Nothing new with titling or labeling for psychological impact in promotion and sales. It is routine in most industries, including both pharmaceuticals and food. For example, non-generic names of pharmaceuticals like Abilify imply able-ness with the ability to boost the effects of antidepressants. (It is actually an antipsychotic). Similarly, food labelled “light” or “slim” tell us what the product proclaims to do often regardless of fat, sugar content, or realistic portions (as in three nibbles qualifying as a full portion). Terms can get rather extreme such as with “super foods” with suggestions and even explicit implications that they can prevent or even help cure cancer.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn4" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn4" class="calibre1">4</a></sup> Items specifically catering to youth and children (and yes, esports) are not spared. For example, intensely caffeinated drinks that wire children tighter than a mouse’s violin (many of which also contain half of their weight in sugar) are labeled “energy drinks” (and are now banned in the UK for children). The list goes on. My point is that often product names and labels are chosen for advertising weight and/or desired consumer function rather than fact (e.g., transparent chemical or ingredient content), and many with little regard for consumer health including what the products actually do, or don’t, do. Gaming is no exception.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">What’s in a Game?</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The retitling of gaming as esports was marketing genius. Having the general public buy in or otherwise adopt the name was further an act of social ingenuity. But how, or why, did they do it? Well I was not in the brainstorming sessions nor the boardrooms, but I suspect the industry piggybacked other positive pastimes’ plight and fight; namely that of chess and bridge. Both chess and bridge have made claims and submitted argument over the years to be included under the title sport. The argument had some validity due to both activities’ rule-bound natures and the mental skill level required to excel. To date, however, they have not succeeded. Why? They are lacking the physical component, of course. As judged by the criterion of the Council of Europe neither chess nor bridge “express or improve physical fitness.” The Council of Europe’s European Sports Charter, article 2.i, states “<em class="calibre2">‘Sport’ means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels</em>.” Here I emphasize “expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being.”<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn5" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn5" class="calibre1">5</a></sup></p>

  <p class="indent">So how did video games get in? How did the term esport establish itself in popular nomenclature and then start to creep in to scholarly dictionaries and, by proxy, chartered definitions? I believe it was magical blending: as previously mentioned I suspect esports probably got fodder and traction from the likes of the arguments supporting the inclusion of chess and bridge as skill building and strategy games. And second, as in the food industry, there is no regulation of a name unless you want to be included in, or officially listed by, a specific organization. The title is not “protected.” So…make your own organization! And that is exactly what gaming did: We now have National Societies and Federations of Esports.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">We’ve Been Outsmarted</h3>

  <p class="noindent">As much as I lament, one thing I have to admire is the absolute brilliance of the minds in the gaming industry (developers, programmers, promoters), especially the early minds. They seem to outsmart therapists, academics, and parents at every turn. With each emergent problem the industry offered a “solution.” And the solution tended not only to be better but also much more successful than the problem presented in the first place. At first, arguably, it was easier, not really an equal playing field. Much of the non-gamer or anti-gamer collective (therapists, educators, parents) simply did not understand. Gaming was not their domain. But now that many do, the industry is still far, far ahead.</p>

  <p class="indent">Long before the retitling of video games as esports, the very real problem the industry had to counter were the cries of children; the infinite chorus of child and adolescent consumers begging, crying, and otherwise tantruming, imploring, their parents by whatever means possible to stay playing their games for 5, 10, 20 minutes and then hours more. The lamenting screams were not only of the message “I want to” but “I need to” and “I have to!”</p>

  <p class="indent">I’ve already discussed a few chapters ago the deviant brilliance of early game design ensuring that children legitimately would be penalized for leaving a game mid-play (or not returning within a set time period). And, how in very short sequence, extreme peer pressure, or social pressure to play took over. Now there is no need for penalization to be designed in to the structure of the game itself; kids penalize each other (socially). So the protestors lost their first protest. The industry is now “innocent.” It is the children’s choice to not want to stop or to return to play.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">The Counterstrike: Gaming, Training, and Becoming a Professional</h3>

  <p class="noindent">A second long-standing argument of the child or adolescent gaming addict or affectionato was that gaming was training. Just like practicing your violin or your guitar, you could make something of yourself and acquire great skills. You could even become a professional. You could get a job as a game programmer or game tester. If you needed credence, there were studies and media feeds supporting this. In response to this misinformed logic many practitioners, myself included, started developing defensive moves in the ever-emergent pro and con game on gaming, (as it pertained to addicted children), as training for greater things. Mine were calculated to help parents to understand the non-relevancy or otherwise help parents see through the distortion of the usefulness of the gamer skillset. For example, what a child needed to learn to become a game programmer versus what they were learning to do while playing had naught to do with each other (e.g., coding versus pressing shooting buttons). Most gaming abilities were largely incomparable or otherwise nontransferable skills except within the tiny classification of game tester. Regarding becoming a professional game tester (as in being paid for playing) I would reference simple statistics in the form of percentages of children who played electric guitar in their basements (did not go to school or work) versus the number who emerged as rock stars. School dropouts draining their parent’s bank accounts far superseded talented musicians or millionaires with brilliant careers. The last card I played was the delusion of the addict: For example, referencing a young man drinking 20 pints of beer a day saying he was practicing to become a brewmaster. His intoxication (e.g., pure brain reward circuitry) was the primary goal, not the development of a discerning palate (e.g., cognitive development) never mind needing to learn chemistry for fermentation process and such.</p>

  <div class="bggray">
    <p class="sb-text"><span class="images"><img alt="image" src="../Images/DY.jpg" class="calibre8"/></span> One of the most prominent if not legendary game developers, Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo who was responsible for the development of Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Wii, and other highly successful products explicitly seeks to hire nongamers. In an interview for the New York Times he explained that he wanted his developers to have other skill sets and other interests than gaming, that “people who play a lot of games are less willing to try new ideas” and how gamers want to perfect what already exists. The success of Nintendo in contrast, lies in experimentation and exploring new ways to have fun. Mr. Miyamoto has found nongamers are more willing to take risk which is also a great part of Nintendo’s success. “I make it a point to ensure they’re not a gamer, but that they have a lot of different interests and skill sets,” Mr. Miyamoto further shared that there was also much value in things that are easy and fun rather than having all kinds of fancy graphics (on which gamers tend to focus). Another less known fact is that two of Mr. Miyamoto’s most successful games, Legend of Zelda and Pimkin, were inspired from his childhood play in nature (more on this later). Perhaps yet another argument that one needs input to have output or inspiration to create.<sup class="calibre12"><a id="Rch17fn6" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn6" class="calibre1">6</a>,<a id="Rch17fn7" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn7" class="calibre1">7</a></sup></p>
  </div>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_265" class="calibre1"></a>But all has changed. For many my analogies above fall mute. The argument of going professional now has validity. Today a child or adolescent can have a career as a gamer. They can make very good money, and the process is not so elite that a typical suburban, urban, or country child could not gain access. This creation and development of a professional gaming industry was an act of sheer genius on the part of the industry. A move beyond brilliant. They made the cries and the arguments of the children true.</p>

  <p class="indent">With industry strategy such as this, practicing therapists, parents, teachers and such are always on the defense. The industry defies magnificence and are much better at cards or chess than we were/are (yes pun intended). I am still trying to decide in this great game of chess if my queen has been taken and I might still survive, or, if I too, am in checkmate…requiring re-strategizing as a therapist for a new game entirely!</p>

  <h4 class="h2"><em class="calibre2">Meet Hyung</em></h4>

  <p class="noindent">Hyung was a lovely young man in his early twenties. He was of Korean origin, attending a Canadian university and obtaining decent grades. He was however suffering from extreme anxiety, chronic insomnia, and was noticing he was starting to have some trouble with emotional regulation including bouts of depression and emergent issues with anger management. Hyung was also a little more emotionally mature and self-aware than your average Canadian born lad of his age, and I soon learned that he was working long hours to put himself through school in Canada (where the tuition fees for non-Canadians were stiff). <a id="page_266" class="calibre1"></a>He lived with three other young men in similar status and they were all gamers.</p>

  <p class="indent">I did my usual probing, and indeed, he and his roommates were dedicating, in my books, far too much time to gaming than was good for their mental or physical health. His brain map revealed the classic deregulation pattern I see in game addicts and his set of symptoms for which he was seeking psychological services were in alignment with what I often saw with excessive or otherwise non-complimentary screen time.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn8" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn8" class="calibre1">8</a></sup> When he returned for his assessment results, I shared my findings with him and how his extensive gaming was probably in large part responsible and a contributor, if not a cause, of his multiple symptoms.</p>

  <p class="indent">In my clinical experience, Hyung’s reaction was not that of the typical game addict. There was no talk back. No counter spewing of the positives of gaming as seen with Yuri or Franco. He was not defensive at all. Rather he slowly started to shake his head, his dark straight hair shifting in counter movement. He then let out a big sigh, leaned over, and covered his face with his hands. After a few moments he rubbed his eyes, broke his defeated posture and shared: “My roommates and I are putting ourselves through university by gaming.” Gaming was his job. And so well paying that he could afford to support himself as a student. Gaming could indeed bring him to his larger goal of becoming an engineer. If he could manage his symptoms, that is.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">Developing Truth</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The new reality is there are now legitimate amateur and professional players and a bazillion dollar industry supporting them. There is now an entire trade, not only manufacturing games and selling them, but also supporting public play. For many, being a gamer is akin to being a college or professional athlete. And, just like in professional sports, players are scouted, join teams/leagues, and some make big money. There are even a few select schools (e.g., Ashland University) jumping on the bandwagon offering gaming scholarships and treating esports as they would other sports. Ashland has an esport program offering up to $4,000 in scholarships. They advertise “a state of the art gaming center with 25 high end PC’s and gaming chairs” and “two 65” high-definition televisions for coaching and entertainment purposes.” Their tag line is “AUesports: Be a Part of the Elite”…“Players compete in Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Starcraft 2 and Rocket League and may compete in the National Association of Collegiate Esports, University League of Legends, Collegiate Starleague, TESPA, AVGL, as well as Professional &amp; Semi-Professional leagues.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Now before we get too excited. Ashland’s promotional material has an underwhelming side too. The university advertises that players will receive “a backpack, jersey, jacket, gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, gaming mousepad, and gaming headset” and “may qualify for Ashland University academic aid and state aid.” Meaning they might get a few gaming trinkets and end up paying for their own gaming experience as well as college. But I doubt this is what hopeful applicants focus on, nor what their parents hear.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn9" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn9" class="calibre1">9</a></sup></p>

  <h3 class="h1">The Building of Big, Big Business</h3>

  <p class="noindent">There are TV channels entirely devoted to gaming like Super Channel’s Esports and GiNX esport TV Canada which feature news shows, review shows, such as: “This Week in Esports” and “Top 10” — and of course the competitions. The shows and games are amazing to watch from an analytic standpoint. They perfectly mimic the language and the intonation of other professional sports: two announcers yelling, cheering, offering descriptive commentary and play by play accounting. “Can he steal it for his team?”…“He is coming down the back side” and “He brings it home!!!!!!” The shows/games are complete with reruns and strategy analysis. They have score updates and some even overtime. It is exactly like watching a football or hockey broadcast except everyone is emphatically excited over animated characters in screen environments.</p>

  <p class="indent">Competitions fill massive stadiums where spectators are on the edge of their seats rooting and roaring for this team and that as they play “live” on massive screens. Sound, music, and streaming player stats keep viewers hyped. Distal audiences watch and re-watch with equal intensity from individual screens from home, work, or the bus. The latest addition involves the introduction of physiological stimuli. The showing of the players’ vital signs like heartrate and ectodermal response (the fancy science word for sweat).<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn10" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn10" class="calibre1">10</a></sup> Facial pattern recognition software is also being introduced to cash in on the emotional status of players. When either the physiological signs and/or the facial expressions of the players (not the characters they play) reach certain thresholds of frustration, joy, anger, et cetera, specific emojis flash on the viewers’ screens. Pilot studies have shown that this new feature both heightened the engagement of viewers (doubled chat conversation) and kept them longer. This is long past and far beyond the comparative micro fame and fortune of YouTube and the like (although there is still much money to be made there too).</p>

  <p class="indent">In terms of what players can earn, Wired Magazine estimated the 2018 available prize money as “close to 100 million” and projects that these numbers will double by 2020. In 2017, in China alone, the collective purse of only one game, Data 2, sat just under $50 Million ($48.5 to be exact by Dec. 2017 statistics). South Korea is dominated by League of Legends with a purse of $18 million. In North America Minecraft is almost passé, child’s play. The big game is Fortnite. It is the most watched (yes watched not played) game that brought in $126 million in profit in February alone<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn11" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn11" class="calibre1">11</a></sup> (CTV News, Vancouver, April 24, 2018). The portion of the profit payed to the players? CBC The Current (May, 2018) reported 100 million dollars available in prize money and $500,000 in yearly earnings for the top player. A talented player can easily earn $5000 per month and that does not even factor in sponsorships. That is very good take home money for an entire family never mind a single youth. Many players who have reached a certain notoriety now also coach or give lessons online (and become coaches in esport oriented colleges). In Korea gamers are treated like stars; some even say gods. Gaming is big, big business beyond the developing and selling of the game. Which brings me to the second point of genius. You don’t even have to buy many games now. If you own a console or a mobile phone (which most of us do) you can start for free.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fortnite, again is the brilliant leader. It can be downloaded for free on multiple platforms (platform is any device that can support a game, e.g., a phone, a PC, iPad etc.). In 2018 it was available (again free) on IOS, PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Here money is not made on the sale of the game itself but on extras. From headsets to cosmetic upgrades to characters/runners (essentially virtual costumes) a player can buy much. How much? Gamerant estimated the Fortnite profit as $223 million in March 2018 alone, and SuperData estimated the take as $296 million in April. Depending on how stats are calculated (how many platforms are included in the count) revenue is between $1.8 and $7.19 million DAILY!<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn12" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn12" class="calibre1">12</a></sup></p>

  <p class="indent">As the numbers indicate, many players subscribe to the thinking that purchasing little and (not so little) extras up their experience or otherwise enhance the game. Like streamers on a bicycle or a brand name on a jersey they do not actually enhance or give advantage to play (according to the producers) but they do increase enjoyment. In gaming, just like in physical character play, it is more fun to play a character in a ramped-up costume than not. I assure you more kids in the 1950s too would have liked to play superman with a red towel as a cape than without. Same in the 1980s with a store-bought cape. I suspect the gaming industry also further capitalizes on advertising psychology operating much like the “no purchase necessary” tag we often see in contests sponsored by specific products. It is clear in the small print that we do not have to buy the product to play (and win) but most of us do anyway. The underlying belief (right or wrong) is that by endorsing the product we have a better chance of winning. The desire to belong and look right while doing so (just like having a red cape as superman, or a branded shirt or special colored shoe while playing or watching hockey or soccer) appeals to us — it seduces us. And so does prize money!</p>

  <h3 class="h1">The Perfect Loop</h3>

  <p class="noindent">A professional circuit provides so, so much more not only to the players but to the purveyors as well: a whole system of free advertising. Not that they may not be out there, but I have never seen a TV advertisement for Fortnite. They don’t need it. Social media, the fan base for the competitions, TV and media focus shows, and the hype regarding the obtainable purses feed gaming companies all the customers they need. Other products and services also now pay for advertising on gaming shows and esport channels. Again, back to the brilliancy of the industry. Those that got it, really got it, and the profits of “free” games often far supersede those of games individuals have to purchase (e.g., the most recent Star Wars game was a flop people believe not because of poor game experience but rather the initial overt cost to a prospective player).</p>

  <p class="indent">Stripped down to its finest, what we now have are free products with potential for earnings through usage. The only thing you need to invest is your time and your enjoyment. Everything else is optional. And that is hard argument for parents to counter.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">Acceptable Caveats of Professional Sport</h3>

  <p class="noindent">What of the second criterion of the Council of Europe’s European Sports Charter of “improving mental well-being?” Well in North America at least, many sports fail. In fact, they can cause mental and physical harm. Two prime examples are hockey and American football (as opposed to soccer). These two sports are notorious for injury. Now, before we run away on ourselves, any elite sport, and arguably many sports done merely for fun (take skiing or snowboarding, mountain biking, gymnastics), have some element of danger. Due to the need for the acquisition and application of physical skill, including strength, coordination, speed, or endurance most sports play on the line. It is also part of the fun. If you recall I argued quite strongly that we need a little danger in play. It is more fun and more importantly it teaches us respect for it (danger that is).</p>

  <p class="indent">Again it is a question of proportions. What are the acceptable proportions of danger to fun, to skill acquisition? And this is my point to esports. I would like us all to query proportions when permitting children to play and partake in esports. For many, transferable skill transition is minimal, and the stakes for addiction are high. Further, excessive play eliminates the acquisition of other skills simply because many children, once engaged in esports, start not doing other things. They don’t play other games or engage in other activities or hobbies.</p>

  <h3 class="h1">A Game of Risk</h3>

  <p class="noindent">I’m not sure if this falls under the classification of industry genius or was just a brilliant coincidence: but by having a potential for professional projection, many accept higher risk. And this now includes esports. It is the cost of getting there and staying there. North American football and hockey are again prime examples.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_271" class="calibre1"></a>Both hockey and North American football have disproportionate injury rates. The most dangerous is the one less obvious, the concussion, also called closed head injury, or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Until very recently head injury was completely downplayed if not dismissed; the gains of the game itself far superseding the value of the individual person or player. Injury is/was a part of the cycle of play rather than a caveat. Still today a rather universal attitude is that the value of the game supersedes the health and welfare of the players. Concussions, excessive alcohol use, and both enhancing and so-called recreational drugs such as cocaine (unless in sports where testing eliminates players from playing) are known but largely ignored. Coaches and owners know many of the young men, by nature of being professional athletes, are wired and need to defuse energy in between and post games and have found self-medicating patterns to moderate. NFL players are called American Gladiators knowing full well the price that may be paid for their fame and glory. But who decides this when they are oh so very young — and how many get injured on the way up the echelon?</p>

  <p class="indent">Colleagues of mine have ventured to find out. A team out of Calgary, Canada, extensively brain mapped an impressive proportion of the 2016–2017 season Canadian junior hockey league players and their findings are eye opening. According to very sophisticated brain-mapping (full QEEG’s or electroencephalographic readings), two-thirds of junior hockey players have had one or more notable head injuries. Two thirds of these again fall into the moderately severe classification — Please don’t be fooled by the term. Moderate-severe is a very serious brain injury! Also note this is the Junior League not the NHL. In personal communication, Dr. Donaldson, the head researcher and an avid hockey fan, also projected that the occurrence within the general population (not only emergent professionals) to be the same. Perhaps of interest to those with children currently playing hockey, the patterns of damage in the brain were consistent with positions played: mostly parietal/temporal and occipital (side and back) and to some extent frontal. Patterns of injury revealed that checking and being thrown into the side boards were largely responsible. The more important message here, however, is that of prevention. If we changed what was permitted in the game, we could prevent much injury to our young players. Another interesting finding was neck girth: Those with thicker necks were more resilient or resistant. The reason once factored in is simple: a thicker more muscular neck is purely stronger and thus less pliable, so the head will hit a surface with less impact of sort.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn13" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn13" class="calibre1">13</a></sup> This is also a factor in why females (the less thicker necked percentage of our species) can have more frequent and more severe concussions (and whiplash) than men. But I digress.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the grand sacrifice of players I now argue that professional esports are becoming frighteningly similar to professional physical sports. Hence, I believe we should be asking ourselves how many (again mostly male) children are left in the sidelines with various forms of illness and injury so a very few can make it big? Many excessive gamers (professional and not) experience the “standard” issues of insomnia, emotional deregulation (anger, anxiety, and depression), develop scholastic challenge (including learning disabilities), and social anxieties when not communicating via a screen. They also self-medicate, most typically with energy drinks. In Asia, notably South Korea and China, pulmonary failure, heart problems, bowel and bladder disorders (because people do not leave their games to go to the washroom), and starvation (because they do not leave their games to eat) are also not uncommon.</p>

  <p class="indent">My seeming digression regarding the nature of brain injuries and neck strength in hockey speaks to a key point: Much as (now that we have looked) we can determine the moves in hockey that cause damage, we can also easily determine if, and when, gaming is causing damage. If we care to look that is. Looking inside the brain tells us all. The building of neck strength of a gamer would simply be to do other things (other than gaming). Protection against concussion for a gamer would be to monitor length and time of play as well as type of play. I believe we owe it to ourselves to intervene now, before, as in hockey and North American football, the value of the game and, college, city, and country tribalism become consistently more important than the person or child playing.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the meantime, the appeals for inclusion for gaming as a sport continue. In 2017 the Swedish esports Federation applied for inclusion in the Riksidrottsförbundet (RF or Swedish Sports Confederation). They failed. For now. The appeal will be relaunched in 2019 to give the RF sufficient time look into reviewing the criterion that define a sport; or as RF Chairman Björn Eriksson put it: “what makes a sport a sport?” The RF must also examine what esports involvement or inclusion in the Confederation would do to the broader organization. In counterargument the chairman of the Swedish esports federation Alexander Hellberg proclaimed that regular sports can learn a lot from esports — in particular, by looking at how they are organized. And, they want to help the RF to redefine sport. Further, that a narrow definition of “sport” would start to exclude and damage the RF instead of the other way around.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="Rch17fn14" class="calibre1"></a><a href="notes.html#ch17fn14" class="calibre1">14</a></sup></p>

  <p class="indent">Oh the arrogance, the conceit, (as it surely can’t be ignorance…) of an industry that modeled itself entirely on the pre-tech platform of professional sports!</p>

  <p class="indent">With the building momentum of the industry, however, they probably are right. The current generation of children are gathering less and less around the stadium or television watching baseball, hockey, or football. They are on their PCs, Macs, pads, and pods watching gaming or playing sport simulating games. As professional sports become more and more expensive to watch live, and amateur sports more expensive to play due to equipment, transport cost, and participation fees, while gaming costs descend, the writing is on the wall.</p>

  <p class="indent">And my client Hyung? Well, he chose what many a professional athlete would choose. Not to stop playing, but rather have his treatment cater to his needs as a player. He chose peak performance treatment to maintain and enhance his mental acuity, as well as calming protocols to reduce his anxiety and improve sleep quality as best as he could until the day comes when he can retire.</p>
